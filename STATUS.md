## Frontend Track (parallel to the manual's 6 phases)

The Nyx brand + product UI was built as a **parallel initiative** (not one of CLAUDE.md's six
numbered phases) and lives in `web/` — a **Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)** app. Status: **DONE
(build-verified; backend logic pending)**.

| Step | Description                                                              | Commit  |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| F1   | Brand board + landing/app/directions from Claude Design (static HTML)    | a1a363b |
| F2   | Convert the design deliverables into a Next.js app                       | cdc9a75 |
| F3   | Make the landing interactive + build the `/app` product frontend         | 16b4899 |

- **Surfaces:** `/` marketing landing (with the schematic "Four steps" settlement-path graph),
  `/app/*` the interactive product frontend (access → desk → compose & seal → pool → proofs →
  settled), and embedded design showcases `/brand-board` + `/directions`; `/deliverables` hub.
- **Source of truth:** the four Claude Design canvases in `web/design-src/*.dc.html` (untouched);
  the landing + app are real TSX, the showcases are rendered verbatim.
- **Verified:** `next build` green — all routes prerender; `npm start` smoke test → every route 200.
- **Not yet wired:** order matching / proof / settlement logic — the buttons and flow are real, the
  **backend hooks land in Phase 5** (the engine work below). `web/README.md` documents the routes,
  the trust/placeholder notes, and the deliberate landing swap.

## Repository State

- **Branch:** `main` · **Remote:** `origin` (github.com/Manuel-dev01/nyx-darkpool)
- **Local is ahead of `origin/main`** by the Phase 3 + Phase 4 commits — the user pushes when
  ready (last verified-synced point was `059ccac` on 2026-06-21).
- **Commit policy:** commit locally only; the user performs all pushes. Commits carry
  **no `Co-Authored-By` trailer** (the author is the user).
- **History note:** the first two commits were rewritten once to remove a
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer (hashes changed: `df5463a`→`2721f31`,
  `5fa4734`→`4b5329d`) and the clean history was force-pushed. Remote and local now
  agree, so normal `git pull` / `git push` work without conflict. The old hashes survive
  only in some commit-message back-references and are harmless.

## Operating Directives (in force at all times)

- **Zero-Assumption / No Hallucinations** — Missing deps/tools/configs are installed,
  configured, and documented. No mock data for cryptographic functions.
- **Self-Verification (TDD)** — After writing code, run the matching compiler/linter/test
  (`go test -race ./...`, `circom --r1cs`, `cargo test`, snarkjs proof checks). Clear all
  warnings before proceeding.
- **Atomic Commits** — Each completed, tested phase ends in a Conventional-Commits commit.
- **Atomic State Tracking** — This file is updated at every state change.
- **Error Handling** — No silent failures. On failure: output the trace, root-cause it,
  fix, re-test.

## Phase 1 Checklist

- [x] `git init` on branch `main`
- [x] Directory topology: `/circuits` `/contracts` `/engine` `/docs` `/scripts`
- [x] `.gitignore` (Go / Node / Rust / env)
- [x] `STATUS.md` (this file)
- [x] `README.md`
- [x] Initial atomic commit `2721f31` → Phase 1 `DONE`

## Phase 2 Checklist

- [x] `go mod init github.com/nyx-darkpool/engine` (Go 1.25.5)
- [x] Scaffold `cmd/server`, `internal/{config,db,api,matcher}`, `db/migrations`
- [x] Migration `000001_init_schema` up/down — `orders`, `matches`, 3 enums, indexes, triggers
- [x] `internal/db/db.go` — pgxpool + Ping + `WithSerializableTx` helper
- [x] `internal/config/config.go` — env-driven, validated, fail-fast
- [x] `cmd/server/main.go` — slog, context propagation, graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown
- [x] `internal/api` `/healthz` (live DB ping); `internal/matcher` lifecycle stub
- [x] `go vet ./...` + `go build ./...` clean
- [x] Verified against Dockerized Postgres: up → constraints/triggers exercised → down → up round-trip
- [x] Atomic commit → record hash in ledger, flip Phase 2 to `DONE`

### Verification evidence (Phase 2)
- `migrate up` created 2 tables + 3 enums + 5 indexes/uniques per table.
- Negative tests passed: nullifier uniqueness rejected; self-match `CHECK` rejected.
- `updated_at` trigger confirmed firing on UPDATE.
- `migrate down -all` removed all tables + custom enums; re-`up` succeeded (reversible).

## Phase 3 Checklist (commits 0460143 → 70bdafd)

- [x] **A** `0460143` `chore(circuits)` — prebuilt circom v2.2.3 installer + pinned node deps
- [x] **B** `e71110a` `feat(circuits)` — `darkpool_match.circom` + trusted-setup pipeline + artifacts
- [x] **C** `a697ee9` `feat(db)` — additive `order_commitment` column (migration 000002)
- [x] **D** `05ac51b` `test(engine)` — unit tests for config, db, health API (+ Pinger seam)
- [x] **E** `ef74c09` `test(engine)` — integration tests: serializable tx + 40001 conflict
- [x] **F** `70bdafd` `feat(scripts)` — off-chain E2E proof-pipeline harness
- [x] **G** `docs(status)` — this update

### Verification evidence (Phase 3 + hardening)
- **Circuit:** compiled to 1539 R1CS constraints (2 public + 6 private); sample Groth16
  proof **verifies (`snarkjs groth16 verify` → OK!)**; `bad-cross` input correctly **fails**
  witness calc at the `lePrice.out === 1` assertion (price-cross enforced).
- **Migration 000002:** `migrate up`/`down 1`/`down -all` all clean (column added then dropped).
- **Unit tests:** `go test ./...` green (config/db/api).
- **Integration tests** (Dockerized Postgres, `-tags=integration`): `WithSerializableTx`
  commit/rollback/panic-rollback, and the **40001 serialization-conflict** test all PASS —
  exactly one of two racing tx commits, the other gets SQLSTATE 40001.
- **Off-chain E2E** (`internal/e2e`): seed → inline match → witness → proof → store
  `proof_blob` → off-chain verify; asserts `public.json == [maker_hash, taker_hash]`, both
  orders `matched`, duplicate-maker match rejected (23505), bad cross rejected. PASS.

### Testing conventions established (hardening)
- Unit tests run offline: `cd engine && go test ./...`.
- DB-dependent tests are gated by `//go:build integration` **and** `NYX_TEST_DB_URL`, so the
  default build needs no database: `go test -tags=integration ./...` (with the env var set).
- One-shot E2E: `NYX_TEST_DB_URL=... bash scripts/e2e_offchain.sh`.

### `go test -race` — SATISFIED (2026-06-22)
The manual mandates `go test -race ./...`. On Windows the race detector requires cgo + a C
compiler. A WinLibs MinGW UCRT toolchain (gcc 16.1.0) is installed at **`C:\mingw64`** (a
space-free path is required — `ld` cannot link from a path containing spaces). Results:

- **Unit:** `PATH=/c/mingw64/bin:$PATH CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race ./...` → all `ok`, no races.
- **Integration + E2E:** `... NYX_TEST_DB_URL=... go test -race -tags=integration -p 1 ./...`
  → all `ok`, **no data races** — incl. the 40001 concurrency test under the race detector.

See `engine/README.md` → "Running tests with the race detector" for the exact commands.

## On-chain E2E seam
The off-chain E2E verifies the proof with snarkjs; the `PHASE-4 HOOK` in
`engine/internal/e2e/e2e_integration_test.go` is now wired to the deployed Soroban contract
(gated by `NYX_SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID`). The `matches` schema (`proof_blob`, `onchain_status`,
`settlement_tx`) modeled on-chain settlement from Phase 2, so no migration was needed.

## Phase 4 Checklist (commits 8744e6a → 74b1a86)

- [x] **A** `8744e6a` `feat(scripts)` — `proof_to_bytes.js` + BN254 `.bin` fixtures
- [x] **B** `cf9b035` `feat(contracts)` — BN254 Groth16 verifier + settlement seam
- [x] **C** `539c79b` `feat(engine)` — env-gated Soroban on-chain bridge (`internal/onchain`)
- [x] **D** `74b1a86` `feat(engine)` — wire e2e PHASE-4 hook + deploy/e2e-onchain scripts
- [x] **E** `c8865ac` `docs(status)` — Phase 4 done
- [x] **F** `4d942f6` `fix(engine)` — stellar invoke arg format + tx-hash parsing (live-validated)
- [x] **G** `3306f4f` `fix(scripts)` — pin Soroban **protocol 26** in `deploy_contract.sh` + RPC
  self-check (a fresh run otherwise boots protocol 25 and fails contract upload); re-verified
  end-to-end with a from-scratch `scripts/e2e_onchain.sh` deploy + on-chain `verify_and_settle`.
- [x] **Live deploy + on-chain e2e run COMPLETE** — deployed to a local Soroban network
  (Docker quickstart, **protocol 26**) and the real Phase-3 proof verified live on-chain.

### Verification evidence (Phase 4)
- **Contract `cargo test`: 6/6 pass**, incl. `valid_proof_verifies` — the **REAL Phase-3 proof
  verifies natively on-chain** via soroban-sdk 26.1.0 BN254 `pairing_check` (proves the byte
  encoding + verifier math). Tamper (proof + public input), replay (`AlreadySettled`),
  wrong-input-count, and missing-auth are all rejected.
- **`stellar contract build` → 6408-byte optimized wasm** (`wasm32v1-none`).
- **G2 byte-ordering footgun resolved up front** by reading the SDK source: soroban-sdk 26.1.0
  documents G1 = `be(X)||be(Y)`, G2 Fp2 = `be(c1)||be(c0)` — matching `proof_to_bytes.js`
  defaults (`G2_ORDERING=c1c0`, `FE_ENDIAN=big`), so the real proof verified first try.
- **Offline `go test ./...` stays green** — the on-chain bridge is disabled unless
  `NYX_SOROBAN_CONTRACT_ID` is set; `internal/onchain` has offline unit tests.
- **LIVE on-chain run (local Soroban network, protocol 26):**
  - Deployed `nyx-verifier`; `verify_and_settle` with the REAL proof → tx success, `Settled`
    event emitted with the correct maker/taker commitments.
  - `is_settled` → `true`; **replay → `Error(Contract, #3)` = AlreadySettled** (on-chain anti-replay).
  - Full Go bridge E2E (`scripts/e2e_onchain.sh`): engine seeds match → proof → deploy →
    invoke → `matches.onchain_status='confirmed'`, `settlement_tx=<64-hex>`. **PASS.**
  - Protocol note: the network MUST run **protocol ≥ 26** (soroban-sdk 26.1 wasm + `g1_msm`).
    Start with `stellar container start local --protocol-version 26` (default boots 25, which
    fails contract upload).

### Toolchain install note (Phase 4)
`rustup`'s downloader repeatedly stalled/hung on this network (the 101 MB `rustc` component;
also Windows rename `os error 145`). Worked around by downloading the rust component tarballs
directly with resumable `curl -C -`, doing an **offline install** into `C:\rust-gnu`, and
linking it into rustup (`rustup toolchain link nyx-gnu C:\rust-gnu`; `rustup default nyx-gnu`).
`stellar contract build` targets **`wasm32v1-none`** (not `wasm32-unknown-unknown`) — its std
was likewise merged in. To rebuild: `PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:/c/mingw64/bin:...` then
`cargo test` / `stellar contract build` from `contracts/nyx-verifier`.

### Signature deviation (documented)
`verify_and_settle` adds a leading `submitter: Address` vs CLAUDE.md's signature, because
`require_auth` needs a principal. Proof argument types (`BytesN<64>/<128>/<32>`,
`Vec<BytesN<32>>`) are exactly as specified. Auth gates the settlement state write; the
Groth16 pairing check is the cryptographic gate.
